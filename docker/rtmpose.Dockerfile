# Dockerfile for RTMPose Estimation Service  
# Optimized for pose estimation inference

# TODO: Implement Docker build for RTMPose service:
# - Base image with MMPose and dependencies
# - Install RTMPose model and configuration files
# - Set up CUDA environment for GPU acceleration
# - Configure model loading and caching
# - Set up service monitoring and health checks

# TODO: Add pose-specific optimizations:
# - Multi-person processing optimization
# - Memory management for large batch inference
# - Model quantization for faster inference
# - Dynamic batch size adjustment
